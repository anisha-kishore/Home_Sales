# Home_Sales
# Background

In this challenge, you'll use your knowledge of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. Then you'll use Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.

# Sources
For this challenge, I used mostly class notes (specifically from class 3 of week 22), and used ChatGPT one query, where it is noted.
